# Loans-Data-Analysis

This is a project for the Coursera course "Data Analysis", taught by Jeff Leek from Johns Hopkins. This objective of this project is use loan data from The Lending Club to determine which factors influence loan interest rate. For example, is it soley FICO score that mostly influences interest rate, or does the amount of the loan, length of time, or geography have an influence as well?

The R statistical software was used to perform exploratory data analysis before developing a multi-variable regression that characterized the influence of the key factors on loan interest rate.
